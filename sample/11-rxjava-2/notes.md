We've talked to Artur about Juno's way to migrate their Android Riders App from RxJava 1 to RxJava 2. We have covered:

- Migration strategy at Juno
- What's different in RxJava 2.0?
- Null values in RxJava 2
- Flowable or Observable?
- Other Rx Types: Single, Maybe and Completable
- RxJava 2 interop library
- RxJava 2: Default UncaughtExceptionHandler logs exceptions silently in jvm unit tests
- RxJava 3
